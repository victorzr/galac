The Snowman

It was nearly Christmas. Katie woke up and found that the world was white and magical.

- Snow,she shouted, snow for Christmas.

She ran outside and danced in the snow. Her brother Eddie came out too.

They made a big round snowball and a small one. They put them together and made a huge snowman. On Christmas Eve they looked at the snowman. He waved at them. He was alive!

Hello, he said, it’s Christmas. Would you like a present?

Yes please! The snowman waved his arms. Silver crystal snowflakes filled the sky. It was so beautiful.

We must give you a present too, said Katie. They gave the snowman a carrot for a nose, a scarf for his neck, and a hat for his head.

Happy Christmas! they said.

The snow stopped and the sun came out. The snowman started to melt.

Goodbye, he said. Build me again next year!
